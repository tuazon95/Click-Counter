# Click-Counter

This is a simple click counter application created in html, CSS and Javascript.

The main purpose of this application is to count the amount of clicks being made using two buttons.
You have a button for Increasing the number (öka) and a button for decreasing the number (minska) and a third to reset (återställ).

As long as the number is a positive number it will remain green, if it is a negative number it will turn red and neutral will always remain black.
